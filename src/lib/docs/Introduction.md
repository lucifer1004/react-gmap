There has been similar packages such as
[tomchentw/react-google-maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps),
[google-map-react/google-map-react](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react),
[fullstackreact/google-maps-react](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react),
so why bother writing a new library?

The aim is to make an easier-to-use Google Map library for React users,
empowered by React's latest features.
